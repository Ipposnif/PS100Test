# PS100Test
The PS-100 is a 16-bit resistive temperature-compensated soil moisture sensor, ideal for the continuous monitoring of wet cultivations.  
This serves as an illustrative guide on how to establish a connection and utilize the PS100 temperature and humidity sensor with Arduino UNO.  
The pull-up resistor can have a value ranging from 2 to 10 kOhm.  
The code supports hot plugging and unplugging of the sensor.
