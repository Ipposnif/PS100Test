# PS100Test
The PS-100 is a 16-bit resistive temperature-compensated soil moisture sensor, ideal for the continuous monitoring of wet cultivations.  
This serves as an illustrative guide on how to establish a 1-Wire connection and utilize the PS100 with Arduino UNO.  
The pull-up resistor can have a value ranging from 2 to 10 kOhm.

After uploading the code to Arduino UNO (https://www.arduino.cc/), open the serial monitor at 9600 Baud, to view real-time temperature and humidity readings.    
The code supports hot plugging and unplugging of the sensor.
